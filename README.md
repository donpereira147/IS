IS(Interoperabilidade Sem√¢ntica)
Semantic Interoperability

This subject dealt with semantic interoperability, where the first assignement, made in Python, dealt with the communication between two machines through TCP/IP sockets, where the messages were HL7 messages. The second assignment consisted of creating a web application and a web service, that would access external API's and retrieve data from them, showing it to the web application. There was also benchmarking done for the second assignment.
